Great job creating your repository and adding your code! To make your `expense_tracker.js` script function as a small program for an end user, here’s what you (and your users) need to do:

---

## 1. Install Node.js

Your script is a Node.js program.  
**If you haven’t already, download and install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

---

## 2. Save the Script

Make sure your `expense_tracker.js` file is in your repository folder.

---

## 3. Open a Terminal

- On **Windows**: You can use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.
- On **Mac/Linux**: Use Terminal.

Navigate (cd) to the folder where `expense_tracker.js` is saved.

---

## 4. Run the Program

In the terminal, run:

```bash
node expense_tracker.js
```

---

## 5. Using the Program

- The script will show a menu.
- Follow the prompts to add expenses, view totals, and save data.
- Expenses are stored in a file called `expenses.json` in the same folder.

---

## 6. (Optional) Make It Easier to Run

If you want to run it by just typing `npm start` or another short command, you can add a `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "expense-tracker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "expense_tracker.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node expense_tracker.js"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## 7. Share with Others

Anyone with Node.js installed can run your program by following the same steps!

---

**Summary:**  
- Install Node.js  
- Open terminal in your repo folder  
- Run `node expense_tracker.js`  
- Use the menu to track expenses!

Let me know if you want tips for packaging, distributing, or making this even more user-friendly (like a desktop app or web version)!
